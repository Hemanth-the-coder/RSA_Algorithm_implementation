# RSA_Algorithm_implementation
RSA algorithm is asymmetric cryptography algorithm. Asymmetric actually means that it works on two different keys i.e. Public Key and Private Key. As the name describes that the Public Key is given to everyone and Private key is kept private.
Algothim find public key and encrypts the message at user's side and also finds private key and uses it to decrpyt and original message.
